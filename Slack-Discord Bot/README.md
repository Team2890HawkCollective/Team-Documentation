# Slack-Discord Bot
Contained in the .zip file in this folder is a bot which will mirror the contents of the 2890 slack's general channel to the slack-announcements channel in discord.  To run simply unzip and launch the executable while it's in the same folder as the matterbridge.toml file.

This bot was pulled from [This opensource project](https://github.com/42wim/matterbridge) and can be modified to work across any number of chat platforms.

Please coordinate with the rest of the team before running the bot yourself, if multiple people are running the bot simultaneously it is likely that message duplication will occur.
